  "description": "<img src=\"/images/screenshot.png\" align=\"right\"/>This is the official Yr Nowcast module for [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror), which displays data from [Yr](https://www.yr.no/nb/). Nowcast data is only available for some Norwegian locations covered by the Norwegian weather radars. See [Explanation (in Norwegian)](https://yrkundesenter.zendesk.com/hc/no/articles/209295525-N%C3%A5varsel-Pr%C3%B8v-v%C3%A5rt-nye-nedb%C3%B8rvarsel-)!  Sometimes the Nowcast will tell you \"no precipitation next 90 minutes\", while the weather symbol contains rain or snow. This is expected, since the weather symbol is based on a weather model and Nowcast is based on radar observations.",
